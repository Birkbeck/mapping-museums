As discussed, we'll need some of the data from the MM report updating: so tables 1-6, 11-22. 

I'm in two minds as to whether to append the tables to the article or just make them available via BIRON. I'm inclined to the later. What do you think? 

I'll also just choose a couple of figures for publication. I'm thinking figs: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10. 

Plus I could do with checking on recent annual growth rates for museums according to subject matter, governance and location. 

And last, there are a few things we didn't work out for the report. Could we do so? 
We looked at density of museums in relation to population at a national level. Could we look at if or how that's changed since 1960? 
Ditto at the level of English regions. I'm just wondering whether we see different patterns of growth in this respect.
